                    <p>I’m a photographer and visual designer with experience spanning commercial advertising, forensic documentation, and generative AI concept development. My path has taken me from studio-lit ad sets in Los Angeles to excavation sites across the Pacific, always with a camera in hand and an eye for visual clarity.</p>
                    <p>Recently, I’ve documented rare prototype and museum-class vehicles at Canepa Automotive, supported high-profile campaigns like Pepsi’s “Back to NFL” with Michael Desmond Productions, and contributed to public communication work for the Bureau of Land Management and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency—where I earned top national honors for photojournalism.</p>
                    <p>Currently continuing my education in photography and graphic design at Johnson County Community College, I’m exploring how emerging tools like AI can support ideation and storytelling without replacing the human eye behind the lens.</p>
                    <p>I’m always looking to connect with others in the visual arts, creative technology, or cultural documentation spaces—especially those building the future of visual communication.</p>
